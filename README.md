# FTNoCSim - simulation platform for evaluating NoC’s reliability
****************************************************************************************************
FTNoCSim, Faut Tolerant Network on Chip simulator is developed at Ecole nationale Supérieure d'Informatique (Algeria).

FTNoCSim is a new platforme that provide a reliability evaluation of 2D network on chip based on OMNeT++ framework. Its architecture and its graphical user-friendly interface (GUI) are designed to make easier the implementation and the evaluation of innovative fault tolerance techniques for three layers of NoC OSI model: data link, network and transport layers.
FTNoCSim can be used to  explore basic concepts of NoC or assess new designs in terms of reliability, latency and power consumption. The later is achieved by integrating Orion2.0 power model. The proposed platform is highly parametrizable. It also provides diferent fault types and scenarios under both, synthetic and realistic traffic patterns.
